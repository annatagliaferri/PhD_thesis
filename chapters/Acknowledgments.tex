Completing a PhD is a journey, and as such it requires the support of many individuals. In this case, I owe thanks to all those who contributed to this endeavor —whether by offering encouragement, constructive criticism, or merely serving as unwitting sources of inspiration.  

To my supervisors, whose guidance has shaped my academic independence more than they might realize —thank you for the lessons, both intentional and accidental.  

To my family, whose influence has left its mark, thank you for being exactly who you are.  

To my friends, who helped keep things light, and to their pets—especially Pinci the cat—thank you for reminding me of life's simpler joys.  

And finally, to those whose presence in my life served as a foil to my perseverance, I extend my gratitude for demonstrating that resilience is cultivated not only through support but also through its absence.
