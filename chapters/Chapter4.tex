\section{Conclusion}

The stabilized EG-CNTFET platform can be successfully used as a signal transducer in biosensors and is compatible with multiple detection elements. Functionalization with an ion-sensitive membrane resulted in the detection of ammonium in a linear manner ($R^2=0.94$) with a sensitivity of \SI{0.14}{\uA \per decade} at concentrations between \SIrange{0.01}{100}{mM}.
Functionalization with aptamers, on the other hand, detected histamine with a linear trend($R^2=0.95$) in concentrations between \SIrange{0.01}{100}{\micro M}, with a sensitivity of \SI{0.15}{\uA \per decade}.
