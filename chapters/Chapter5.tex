\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, a mathematical model describing the behavior of EG-CNTFETs was developed to link theoretical understanding and experimental observations. The simulation environment was established using COMSOL Multiphysics, implementing the Nernst-Planck-Poisson framework to capture the coupled dynamics of charge transport and electrostatics within the device structure. The geometry was defined to represent the fabricated transistors, and relevant material and physical parameters were assigned based on experimental data and literature values. Although the simulation work is still ongoing, the current setup lays the foundation for exploring the influence of various design and operational parameters on device performance. Once convergence issues are resolved and the mesh optimized, the model is expected to provide meaningful insights into potential distribution, charge accumulation, and the role of interfacial processes, complementing experimental efforts and contributing in future device optimizations.
