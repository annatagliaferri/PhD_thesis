\subsection{Materials}

The devices are composed of a polyimide substrate (\SI{50}{\um}), titanium, gold, and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, \SI{95}{\%}, Merck). Additional chemicals employed during fabrication were
ma-n 1420 photoresist (Microresit), ma-D 533 S developer (Microresist), both used during photolithography (Section \ref{sec:lithography}), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, Merck), a surfactant necessary during SWCNT deposition, and nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}, Merck), to remove said surfactant at the appropriate time. The lipophilic membrane was synthesized combining \SI{5}{\%} tetradodecylammonium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl) borate (Merck), \SI{32.3}{\%} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC, Merck), and \SI{62.7}{\%} dioctyl sebacate (Merck); the reagents were then diluted in \SI{1}{\ml} tetrahydrofuran (THF, Merck). A second, ionophore-containing membrane used for functionalization purposes consisted of \SI{0.2}{\%} nonactin (Merck), \SI{30.8}{\%} PVC (Merck), and \SI{69}{\%} ortho-nitrophenyl octyl ether (O-NPOE, Merck); it was also diluted in \SI{1}{\ml} THF. Histamine aptamers (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) in combination with thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG, Merck) were used as a second functionalization strategy. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Merck, pH 7.2--7.6, \SI{1}{tablet} per \SI{200}{\ml}) and ferricyanide/ferrocyanide (Fe[\ce{CN}]\textsuperscript{3-/4-}, Merck) were subsequently employed for electrical characterization of the fabricated devices and sensors. Other materials widely employed throughout the process included acetone (Merck), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, Merck).

\subsection{Equipment}

% Litho + evap
The instrumentation used for electrode fabrication comprised oven, spin coater, a mask aligner equipped with a UV lamp, and an evaporator. 
% CNT spray
Subsequently, the CNT solution was prepared using a horn sonicator (Fisherbrand FB-505), an ultrasound sonicator, and a centrifuge (Thermo Scientific SL 16 with 15-6 rotor); the solution was then deposited using a spray coater equipped with an industrial air atomizing spray valve (Nordson EFD, USA). A plasma asher (Diener Femto series) was employed prior to CNT deposition to ensure a clean surface and to increase contact angle.
% Functionalization
Functionalization first required cleaning through an ozone cleaner (Ossila), then aptamer preparation using Zeba spin desalting columns (\SI{7}{\kilo\dalton} MWCO, \SI{0.5}{\ml}, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) and a centrifuge (Eppendorf 5420 with FA-24x2 rotor).
% Characterization
Device imaging and characterization was carried out after, employing techniques such as optical microscopy (Axio Imager, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany), scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-IT 100, JEOL, Japan), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Omicron Nanotechnology Multiprobe UHV-surface-analysis system with Al~K\textalpha{} source, \SI{1486.7}{\electronvolt}), atomic force microscopy (AFM; Nanosurf CoreAFM, Switzerland) and profilometry (KLA Tencor P-6). Electrical characterization was later performed using a probe station connected to a Keysight B1500A semiconductor device parameter analyzer and a potentiostat (VersaSTAT 4, Princeton Applied Research, USA).

Simulations and numerical analyses were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2, executed on the Tetralith high-performance computing cluster managed by the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS), more specifically by the National Supercomputer Centre (NSC)
at Link√∂ping University. Tetralith is the primary system of NSC, with a cluster \num{1908} compute nodes, each with two Intel Xeon Gold 6130 CPUs (32 cores).
