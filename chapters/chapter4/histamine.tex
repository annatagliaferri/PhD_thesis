\note{To achieve selective detection of histamine using an electrolyte-gated field-effect transistor (EG-FET), the functionalization of the gate electrode is essential. Without a dedicated sensing layer, the device lacks specificity and may respond to various interfering species. This section describes the modification of the gate with a histamine-selective recognition element, enabling precise and reliable detection.}
